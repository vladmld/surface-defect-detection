# Surface defect detection

Libraries used: OpenCV

## Project stages

### 1. Data collection

https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/arunrk7/surface-crack-detection

### 2. Data preprocessing

- Organizing the data into two separate folders: with defects and without defects
- Preprocessing the data:
  - Resizing the images for them to be the same size (227 × 227 pixels)
  - Normalization of pixels values to [0, 1]

### 3. Model Architecture

### 4. Training the model

### 5. Model evaluation

### 6. Model deployment

### 7. Continous improvement
